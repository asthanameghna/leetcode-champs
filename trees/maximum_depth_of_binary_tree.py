# Approach
# Use Depth First Search (DFS) with recursion.
# For each node, compute the depth of the left subtree and the right subtree.
# The depth of the current node is:
#     1 + max(depth(left), depth(right))
# The recursion stops when we reach an empty node (None), which has depth 0.

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# We visit each node exactly once.

# Space Complexity: O(h)
# h = height of the tree due to the recursion call stack.
# Worst case (skewed tree): O(n)
# Best case (balanced tree): O(log n)

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if root is None:
            return 0

        left_depth = self.maxDepth(root.left)
        right_depth = self.maxDepth(root.right)

        depth = 1 + max(left_depth, right_depth)

        return depth
